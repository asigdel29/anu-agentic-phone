//   2026-08-08  A. Sigdel  Created, empty of everything but a screen. The
//                          credential, the turn loop and the tools follow.
//   2026-08-09  A. Sigdel  A release build, and the one R8 rule without which
//                          it installs and dies at the first native call.
//   2026-08-13  A. Sigdel  Reads the signing variables the way a daemon cannot
//                          make stale, #514.
//
// The two SDK levels below are decisions, not defaults, and both are the kind
// somebody tidies up. Each carries its reason at the line.
