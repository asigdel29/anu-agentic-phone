// TurnDriver.kt — starting a turn, watching it, and stopping it.
//
// History
//   2026-08-08  A. Sigdel  Created.
//
// The object a screen holds: the transcript, whether a turn is running, and
// the last decision for a routing panel.
//
// Interrupting is cancelling the coroutine and nothing else. Every layer below
// was built for it — the flow is cold and cancels with its collector, the
// client checks per line because tool-call fragments emit nothing for a long
// stretch, and ToolBox rethrows CancellationException alone. A flag here would
// be a second answer to "is this turn over".
//
// The generation counter is the part that is not bookkeeping. Interrupt, then
// send again: the first turn unwinds *after* the second has started, and
// clearing isRunning on the way out would leave the second invisible while it
// ran. Job identity does not work — the job that finishes is not the one the
// caller last kept.
