// Transcript.kt — a turn's events, folded into what a person reads.

// Contents
//   Row         One line of the conversation as it is shown.
//   Transcript  The fold, and the rows it has produced.
//
// Every rule below exists because the naive version looks wrong on screen, and
// putting them in a composable would mean deciding per event whether to open a
// bubble or extend one — in a function that also has to lay one out.
//
// Ids come from a counter rather than a position in the list, so a row that
// grows keeps its identity. A LazyColumn keyed on position re-creates every
// item below an insert, which is visible as the whole conversation flickering
// each time a fragment arrives.
